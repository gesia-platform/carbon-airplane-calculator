## üìñ Overview
The Smart Contract-Based Footprint Calculator is a decentralized tool designed to estimate the carbon footprint associated with pete consumption. This smart contract operates on a blockchain platform and provides a straightforward way to calculate and retrieve carbon emission data from the blockchain.

## ‚ú® Features
**Calculate Carbon Footprint (Public)**: Users can calculate the carbon footprint from the set AirPlane carbon emission factor. This public function returns an estimate of the carbon footprint associated with the weight of the AirPlane.

## üìù How is it calculated?
The carbon emissions are calculated based on the emission factors and calculation methods referenced from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft) and [aeroflot](https://www.aeroflot.ru/kr-ko/about/calculator_co2/method)

The following formula is the essential formula of Carbon Footprint Calculator.
``` plain
# emission factor of individual passenger: 3.16
# T(tot): Total payload transport fuel consumption(Average Fuel Burn x range)
# P(pax/tot): Ratio of passenger weight to total payload weight
# N(seat): Total number of seats
# K(pax/seat): Ratio of seats occupied during flight

emission factor of airplane(kgCO2/kg) x is business class(true: 2, false: 1) x Average Fuel Burn(kg/km) x range(km) x P(pax/tot) √∑ (N(seat) x K(pax/seat))
```
